# Graduation-Planning-System (GPS)
St. Cloud State University year-long Senior project
Part one of this project consists of a backend service that will parse user information 
from a file containing course history and program requirements,
model the requirements to allow a student to choose sufficient elective courses to complete their program,
and generate an editable plan that contains both required and elective courses.

Part two of this project consists of building a report-generating platform for St. Cloud State University
that will allow the university to use data generated by students using the GPS to create graduation plans
to predict future enrollment and more efficient plan future course offerings.
